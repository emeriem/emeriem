## About Me

I'm a software developer, educator, and creative technologist building tools, experiences, and ecosystems for Africa’s digital future. Through **SkillForge Academy**, I train beginners and aspiring professionals in **Web Development, UI/UX Design, Digital Literacy, and more**, with a strong focus on **practical skills, mentorship, and inclusion**.

When I’m not coding, I’m teaching, designing, or dreaming up the next big idea. I'm also the lead on **Lucid Dreams Innovations**, our umbrella company focused on building smart business software and scalable digital tools.
